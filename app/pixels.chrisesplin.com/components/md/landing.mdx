## Greetings!

This extension is dedicated to my fellow pixel pushers.

You've got designers. Your designers have needs. You fulfill those needs, sometimes at great personal expense.

**Designer:** But muh kerning!!!

**Dev:** Doooode... it's not going to happen. Fonts display differently on web, and besides... it'll never look quite the same on Windows anyway.

**Designer:** I've been staring at this design for days and this is how it needs to look. I've considered everthing. Please, please, please make this happen for us.

**Dev (2 days later):** I did it! You crazy designer. I hope you appreciate how arduous that was.

Sincerely,

Chris Esplin

### How do I pixel-match?

Pixels packages the tools that you need in a browser extension.

Here's what you'll need to do:

1. Drag and drop your mocks into new browser tabs.
1. Open up Chrome Dev tools and navigate to the "Pixels" tab.
1. Drop guidelines on your mocks.
1. View those guidelines on your development website.
1. Tweak the CSS to your heart's content.
1. Profit. Seriously. People pay good money for pixel-perfect websites.

### Direct Download

I'm working to getting Pixels hosted on the Chrome Web Store. They've given me grief in the past, so I'm distributing the unpacked extension as well.

This may not be the tool for you if you don't know how to install an unpacked Chrome extension.

- Unpacked extension: [pixels.zip](/extension/pixels.zip)
- Packed extension: [pixels.zip](/extension/pixels.crx)
- Chrome Web Store: [Pixels](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pixels/ibjfclodnfhjfighgdglngeaepomnamk?hl=en)

### Contribute

The code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/deltaepsilon/pixels). Go check it out, fork it, modify it to your heart's content... and let me know how it goes!

### Terms of Service

I don't charge anything, so you don't get any special guarantees. I'll be honest and not mess with your browser. That's about it.

Please don't repackage and sell this app just because the code is open source. That would be lame. Please email me at [chris@chrisesplin.com](mailto:chris@chrisesplin.com) if you're interested in re-purposing my code in any way.

### Privacy Policy

#### How do I use the information?

I don't use your information at the moment. I may send you an email in the future. If I do decide to **send email**, it will be respectful and will contain a one-click opt-out link.
