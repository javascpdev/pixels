## Quick Start

Once Pixels is hosted on the Chrome Web Store you'll be able to install the packed extension (.crx).

If you're comfortable with the bleeding edge, experimental version, try the unpacked extension (.zip).

If you don't know how to install an unpacked Chrome extension... maybe reconsider. This extension has access to all of your tabs and data, so while *I* know that it's safe, you'd have to read the source code to verify that yourself.

- Unpacked extension: [pixels.zip](/extension/pixels.zip)
- Packed extension: [pixels.crx](/extension/pixels.crx)
- Chrome Web Store: [Pixels](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pixels/ibjfclodnfhjfighgdglngeaepomnamk?hl=en)

### How do I pixel-match?

Pixels packages the tools that you need in a browser extension.

Here's what you'll need to do:

1. Drag and drop your mocks into new browser tabs.
1. Open up Chrome Dev tools and navigate to the "Pixels" tab.
1. Drop guidelines on your mocks.
1. View those guidelines on your development website.
1. Tweak the CSS to your heart's content.
1. Profit. Seriously. People pay good money for pixel-perfect websites.

### Greetings!

This extension is dedicated to my fellow pixel pushers.

You've got designers. Your designers have needs. You fulfill those needs, sometimes at great personal expense.

I've been a front-end dev for a few weeks now, and I'm sick and tired of guess-and-check workflows when matching my designer's mocks. The finished product needs to be indistinguishable from the designs, and that's nearly impossible to achieve with current tools.

I'm building the tools that I wish existed. I hope you like them.

Let me know what you think by messaging me on my Twitter page: [@ChrisEsplin](https://twitter.com/chrisesplin)

Sincerely,

Chris Esplin

I don't charge anything, so you don't get any special guarantees. I'll be honest and not mess with your browser. That's about it.

Please don't repackage and sell this app just because the code is open source. That would be lame. Please email me at [chris@chrisesplin.com](mailto:chris@chrisesplin.com) if you're interested in re-purposing my code in any way.
